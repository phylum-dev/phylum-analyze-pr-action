This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2020-10663.\nWe strongly recommend upgrading the json gem.\n\nDetails\n-------\n\nWhen parsing certain JSON documents, the json gem (including the one bundled\nwith Ruby) can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in the target system.\n\nThis is the same issue as CVE-2013-0269. The previous fix was incomplete, which\naddressed JSON.parse(user_input), but didnâ€™t address some other styles of JSON\nparsing including JSON(user_input) and JSON.parse(user_input, nil).\n\nSee CVE-2013-0269 in detail. Note that the issue was exploitable to cause a\nDenial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable Symbol objects, but\nthis kind of attack is no longer valid because Symbol objects are now\ngarbage-collectable. However, creating arbitrary objects may cause severe\nsecurity consequences depending upon the application code.\n\n\n### Recommendation\nUpgrade to >= 2.3.0",

Upgrade to Nokogiri\n`1.11.0.rc4` or later.\n\nIf, after upgrading to `1.11.0.rc4` or later, you wish\nto re-enable network access for resolution of external resources (i.e., return to\nthe previous behavior):\n\n1. Ensure the input is trusted. Do not enable this option\nfor untrusted input.\n2. When invoking the `Nokogiri::XML::Schema` constructor,\npass as the second parameter an instance of `Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions` with the\n`NONET` flag turned off.\n\nSo if your previous code was:\n\n``` ruby\n# in v1.11.0.rc3 and earlier, this call allows resources to be accessed over the network\n# but in v1.11.0.rc4 and later, this call will disallow network access for external resources\nschema = Nokogiri::XML::Schema.new(schema)\n\n# in v1.11.0.rc4 and later, the following is equivalent to the code above\n# (the second parameter is optional, and this demonstrates its default value)\nschema = Nokogiri::XML::Schema.new(schema, Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::DEFAULT_SCHEMA)\n```\n\nThen you can add the second parameter to indicate that the input is trusted by changing it to:\n\n``` ruby\n# in v1.11.0.rc3 and earlier, this would raise an ArgumentError\n# but in v1.11.0.rc4 and later, this allows resources to be accessed over the network\nschema = Nokogiri::XML::Schema.new(trusted_schema, Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions.new.nononet)\n```\n\n### Recommendation\nUpgrade to >= 1.11.0.rc4",

          "description": "### Overview\n### Summary\n\nNokogiri v1.11.4 updates the vendored libxml2 from v2.9.10 to v2.9.12 which addresses:\n\n- [CVE-2019-20388](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-20388) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2020-24977](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-24977) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3517](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3517) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3518](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3518) (Medium severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3537](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3537) (Low severity)\n- [CVE-2021-3541](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3541) (Low severity)\n\nNote that two additional CVEs were addressed upstream but are not relevant to this release. [CVE-2021-3516](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3516) via `xmllint` is not present in Nokogiri, and [CVE-2020-7595](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-7595) has been patched in Nokogiri since v1.10.8 (see #1992).\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.11.4`, and only if the packaged version of libxml2 is being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `libxml2` release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.11.4`.\n\n\n### Impact\n\nI've done a brief analysis of the published CVEs that are addressed in this upstream release. The libxml2 maintainers have not released a canonical set of CVEs, and so this list is pieced together from secondary sources and may be incomplete.\n\nAll information below is sourced from [security.archlinux.org](https://security.archlinux.org), which appears to have the most up-to-date information as of this analysis.\n\n#### [CVE-2019-20388](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-20388)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: A memory leak was found in the xmlSchemaValidateStream function of libxml2. Applications that use this library may be vulnerable to memory not being freed leading to a denial of service.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/7ffcd44d7e6c46704f8af0321d9314cd26e0e18a\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri < v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2020-7595](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-7595)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: xmlStringLenDecodeEntities in parser.c in libxml2 2.9.10 has an infinite loop in a certain end-of-file situation.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/0e1a49c8907645d2e155f0d89d4d9895ac5112b5\n\nThis has been patched in Nokogiri since v1.10.8 (see #1992).\n\n\n#### [CVE-2020-24977](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-24977)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Information disclosure\n- **Description**: GNOME project libxml2 <= 2.9.10 has a global buffer over-read vulnerability in xmlEncodeEntitiesInternal at libxml2/entities.c.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/commit/50f06b3efb638efb0abd95dc62dca05ae67882c2\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri < v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3516](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3516)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Arbitrary code execution (no remote vector)\n- **Description**: A use-after-free security issue was found libxml2 before version 2.9.11 when \"xmllint --html --push\" is used to process crafted files.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/230\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/1358d157d0bd83be1dfe356a69213df9fac0b539\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. This vector does not exist within Nokogiri, which does not ship `xmllint`.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3517](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3517)\n\n- **Severity**: Medium\n- **Type**: Arbitrary code execution\n- **Description**: A heap-based buffer overflow was found in libxml2 before version 2.9.11 when processing truncated UTF-8 input.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/235\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/bf22713507fe1fc3a2c4b525cf0a88c2dc87a3a2\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11.

It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri < v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3537](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3537)\n\n- **Severity**: Low\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: It was found that libxml2 before version 2.9.11 did not propagate errors while parsing XML mixed content, causing a NULL dereference. If an untrusted XML document was parsed in recovery mode and post-validated, the flaw could be used to crash the application.\n- **Issue**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/243\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/babe75030c7f64a37826bb3342317134568bef61\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri < v1.11.4.\n\n\n#### [CVE-2021-3541](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3541)\n\n- **Severity**: Low\n- **Type**: Denial of service\n- **Description**: A security issue was found in libxml2 before version 2.9.11. Exponential entity expansion attack its possible bypassing all existing protection mechanisms and leading to denial of service.\n- **Fixed**: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/8598060bacada41a0eb09d95c97744ff4e428f8e\n\nVerified that the fix commit first appears in v2.9.11. It seems possible that this issue would be present in programs using Nokogiri < v1.11.4, however Nokogiri's default parse options prevent the attack from succeeding (it is necessary to opt into `DTDLOAD` which is off by default).\n\nFor more details supporting this analysis of this CVE, please visit #2233.\n\n\n### Recommendation\nUpgrade to >= 1.11.4",
